Rapid voice-based biometric authentication.

We have a web-based biomedical/AI platform used for open-source COVID-19 research. Users currently log in via magic link, but we would like to add an option where the person is identified via voice through the browser. Ideally we would generate a phrase for the user to speak into a laptop/PC microphone, at which time the user would be rapidly authenticated and would be granted access.
